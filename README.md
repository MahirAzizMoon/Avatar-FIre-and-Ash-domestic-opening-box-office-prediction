# Avatar: Fire and Ash domestic opening Week Box Office Revenue Prediction

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the **opening domestic week box office revenue** of an unreleased film, using *Avatar: Fire and Ash* as a case study.

## What I Did
- Scraped historical movie metadata using the **TMDB API**
- Combined metadata with historical box office revenue
- Cleaned and engineered features suitable for pre-release prediction
- Trained and evaluated multiple regression models
- Estimated prediction uncertainty using historical error patterns
- Generated a baseline opening-week revenue prediction for the upcoming Avatar release

## Why It Matters
Opening-week revenue is a key indicator of a film’s commercial performance. This project demonstrates how publicly available data can be used to build a realistic, data-driven forecast before release.

## Tools & Skills
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- API-based data collection
- Feature engineering
- Regression modeling and evaluation

## Notes
The final prediction should be interpreted as a baseline estimate. Factors such as marketing spend, theater count, and franchise-specific effects are not fully captured.
